# First Project in C++ with SFML(3.0DLL)

This is my first C++ project, a small racing car game built using the SF
Made a rectangular box car with help of SFML library 
Gave basic speed a constant value of float and also added speed up value when W key will be pressed
Created various function storing
1) Keys input (Eg W , A , S ,D)
2) Trignometry angles which helped in rotation of car and connects to speed
3) Friction and other forces acting when no key is pressed or when S key is pressed how much force will car take to stop moving
4) Then created a Track with help of SFML library (3.0 DLL) 
5) Created Rules if Car goes out of track it will reset to original position

## What I Learned
1) C++ fundamentals
2) Using SFML for graphics and input
3) Game loop structure
4) Debugging real-time applications
